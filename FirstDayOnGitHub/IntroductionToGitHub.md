# Introduction to GitHub

**GitHub:** GitHub is a collaboration platform that uses Git for versioning. GitHub is a popular place to share and contribute to open-source software.

**Repository:** A repository is a project containing files and folders. A repository tracks versions of files and folders.

**Branch:** A branch is a parallel version of your repository. By default, your repository has one branch named `main` and it is considered to be the definitive branch. You can create additional branches off of `main` in your repository. You can use branches to have different versions of a project at one time.
On additional branches, you can make edits without impacting the `main` version. Branches allow you to separate your work from the `main` branch. In other words, everyone's work is safe while you contribute.

**Profile README:** A profile README is essentially an "About me" section on your GitHub profile where you can share information about yourself with the community on GitHub.com. GitHub shows your profile README at the top of your profile page.
